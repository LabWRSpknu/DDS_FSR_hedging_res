# DDS_FSR_hedging_res
Python version of the Dynamically dimensioned search allowing flexible search range (DDS-FSR)
developed by Jin Y.

The DDS-FSR was modified the Dynamically dimensioned search algorithm (DDS).
The DDS-FSR is purposed to efficiently solve constrained optimization problems.

The python version of the DDS-FSR was modifed the DDS-Py.
The DDS-Py was coded on Aug 2015 by Thouheed Abdul Gaffoor (https://github.com/t2abdulg/DDS_Py).

README:

This file contains the user instructions for the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) Algorithm by Bryan A. Tolson.  
DDS is an n-dimensional, heuristic, probabilistic global optimization algorithm for continuous/discrete/mixed 
decision-variable, box-constrained (bound-constrained) optimization problems.  
DDS is designed to find good solutions quickly and requires no algorithm parameter tuning.
